            Localizing seamless pipes manufacturing in the Middle East – in general, and in Saudi Arabia – in particular, was a commercial necessity and a strategic decision. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is currently the most growing region related to Oil and Gas industry. GCC is having a strong demand for seamless pipes and various projects will sustain and even increase such demand in future. This regional development would benefit from a local supply of seamless pipes now that JESCO comes on stream.

            JESCO benefits from its ideal location to deliver to GCC National & International Oil and Gas Companies, shortening their Supply Chain with thousands of miles and hundreds of days.
